# pretty-print

This is a sample groovy REST project to pretty print a JSON string.

It also has the terraform scripts to build and deploy the service to an AWS ECS container.  

The pretty print service is deployed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chuckh/pretty-print/).

The base docker image is built and deployed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chuckh/rhel7-jdk/). It is based on Red Hat Linux 7 with JDK 1.8.0_121 and can be found in my [docker-examples project](https://github.com/chuckhutchinson2/docker-examples/tree/master/rhel7-java)
